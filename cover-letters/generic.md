To whom it may concern:

Thank you for your consideration! I consider myself someone dedicated to a life of learning. I went to college to study physics, however in my time there I discovered the world of computing. I tinkered with hardware and started installing Linux anywhere and everywhere. Shell scripting came soon after, opening up the world of software to me. I graduated college with a major in physics and a minor in mathematics, however my urge to learn was not fulfilled. I completed a bootcamp experience through DevMountain, learning the essentials of fullstack web development and what it's like to be a software engineer.

Here I am now with a new outlook on software and an even greater urge to learn more! I strive to write readable code that just makes sense, regardless of the complexity of what the code may actually be doing. I enjoy writing minimal code that does what it's supposed to, and I also find great value in the Unix philosophy: "make each program do one thing well". In 10 years, I see myself in a place where I can continue to learn new technologies as well as mentor those who have the same drive and passion.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best,
Jared Baur
