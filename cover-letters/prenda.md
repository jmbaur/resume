To the Prenda hiring staff:

Thank you for your consideration! I am excited to be applying to a company with such a refreshing take on education. I spent a year in college working for CollegeSpring, a company aiming to provide SAT prep to low-income background students. I was a mentor there, and each week I got the opportunity to work with the same group of 6 students, growing a bond and trust that really fostered development on their end. And on my end, I definitely learned how empowering education could be. I see a lot of the same values from CollegeSpring in Prenda, and as an education/lifelong-learner type, I want to surround myself with like-minded people in my day-to-day.

I hope to speak with you all in the near future!

Best,
Jared Baur
