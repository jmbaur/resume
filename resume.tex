\resumeSubHeadingListStart

\resumeSubheading{Anduril Industries}{Costa Mesa, CA}
{Software Engineer (full-time)}{March 2023 - April 2025}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{NixOS on Embedded}{Provided superior platform support for NixOS on
embedded platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson, NXP IMX8, and Xilinx Zynqmp/Versal.
This involved bootloader (U-Boot, EDK2) and Linux kernel bringup on custom
carrier boards and peripherals used by various products.}
\resumeItem{Security}{Implemented custom program for writing OTP fuses on
Xilinx Zynqmp/Versal boards. This involved writing a baremetal program that
would accept a payload of data to write to the fuses, validating the data for
the current board being ran on, then performing the fusing. This was crucial
for implementing verified boot on Xilinx platforms.}
\resumeItem{Testing}{Maintained and improved upon a custom hardware testing
platform for 50+ individual devices. This involved testing various aspects of a
device's lifecycle, such as firmware updates, NixOS installations, and tests
that perform various platform and hardware specific functions.}
\resumeItem{Manufacturing}{Created and maintained NixOS modules for the purpose
of manufacturing new NixOS devices. Aided in rolling this out to various teams
and products on the manufacturing floor. This included bootstrapping devices
with platform firmware, fusing devices for the purpose of verified boot, and
performing NixOS installations over the network.}
\resumeItemListEnd

\resumeSubheading{Adobe, Inc.}{Remote}
{Software Engineer (full-time)}{May 2022 - March 2023}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Site Reliability}{Implemented new features for and maintained a
service aimed at performing automatic remediation of issues encountered for
analytics services within the company. This service was capable of monitoring
hundreds of other services and made the lives of on-call technicians easier by
performing many tasks for them. New features implemented included adding
internal team monitoring, adding integration for new analytics services, and
creating common abstractions around existing services.}
\resumeItemListEnd

\resumeSubheading{Prenda, Inc.}{Remote}
{Software Engineer (full-time)}{August 2020 - April 2022}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Authn/Authz}{Implemented an authorization server that enabled other
services to create a root of trust for their consumers. The server used
JWT/JWKs as an interface to other services (implementing RFCs 7517 \& 7519),
which allowed services to ensure authentication and gather authorization
details of a specific principal.}
\resumeItem{Infrastructure}{Utilized the AWS CDK tool to create a library
developer teams could consume to create their desired infrastructure. This
included CI/CD pipelines, integration of custom Cloudformation resources to
manipulate infrastructure in Cloudflare, as well as better defaults for
resources that do networking to enable a dual-stack setup. The usage of the
library led to an increase in holistic quality of infrastructure and enabled
product teams to meet deadlines with an increase in iteration time and
developer productivity.}
\resumeItemListEnd

\resumeSubheading
{CSAA}{Glendale, AZ}
{IT Technician (full-time)}{September 2019 - January 2020}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Automation}{Wrote shell scripts to automate employee provisioning
steps, taking a step that took hours manually down to minutes}
\resumeItem{Virtualization}{Worked with virtualization solutions to aid in
software development testing environments.}
\resumeItemListEnd

\resumeSubheading
{Abbott Laboratories}{Sylmar, CA}
{Data Analyst (full-time intern)}{June 2018 - December 2018}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Public Image Project}{Led a new project to raise awareness of
company public image through data analysis and automation. Python was utilized
to create a tool that could scrape various social media sites for posts about
the company, perform sentiment analysis of said posts, and then automate the
pipeline so that relevant teams were always kept up to date on the latest
posts. This led to increased focus and prioritization on happy and unhappy
customers alike, allowing for better planning of customer interaction
(conventions, meetings, etc).}

\section{Projects/Open-Source Work}
\resumeSubHeadingListStart
\resumeSubItem{tinyboot - https://github.com/jmbaur/tinyboot}
{A bootloader leveraging Linux's kexec feature. Has been written from the
ground up implementing a small (<100KiB) program written in Zig that discovers
bootable devices using the Boot Loader Specification (see
https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot\_loader\_specification/).
Along with a custom-built kernel that is optimized for size, the initrd and
kernel built from this project can be written to flash storage of many
different devices. Initial inspiration for this was from the LinuxBoot project
(see https://www.linuxboot.org).}
\vspace{2pt}
\resumeSubItem{NixOS - https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs}
{Over a hundred commits to the NixOS project, specializing in bootloader and
systemd related changes. Migrated the switch-to-configuration program, a core
component of the NixOS deployment model to a new Rust program that integrates
tightly with the state of the NixOS machine and manages transitioning one NixOS
configuration to another.}
\vspace{2pt}
\resumeSubItem{homelab - https://github.com/jmbaur/homelab}
{My "dumping ground" of experiments with new hardware, network setups, etc.
Almost all of it is NixOS based and automated to the point where most of my
machines are fairly hands-off once the initial deployment has been made.}
\vspace{2pt}
\resumeSubItem{bathroom-fan-switch - https://github.com/jmbaur/bathroom-fan-switch}
{A baremetal Zig program that runs on the RP2040 MCU to automate turning on/off
my bathroom fan. A humidity sensor hooked up via I2C along with a manual
override switch attached via GPIO is used to change the state of the bathroom
fan when the humidity changes.}
